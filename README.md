# Time-series glucose prediction with LSTM and federated learning
This repository hosts code for predicting glucose levels in a federated learning context using the [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) framework. The dataset employed is [OHIOT1DM](http://smarthealth.cs.ohio.edu/OhioT1DM-dataset.html), and it is available upon request from the authors. The current configuration of the repository accommodates an arbitrary number of clients, provided that the folders are appropriately configured. Users have the flexibility to adjust various parameters, such as the number of local or global training rounds and the learning rate, to conduct experiments and explore different settings.
